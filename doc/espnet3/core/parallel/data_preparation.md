# ESPnet3 Data Preparation With Providers And Runners

The same provider/runner infrastructure can be used for dataset preparation.

This is useful when a recipe needs work such as:

- downloading many source files
- unpacking or normalizing raw data
- building manifests
- computing derived metadata in parallel

The idea is the same as inference:

1. the provider builds shared runtime objects
2. the runner processes indices
3. shard outputs are merged at the end

## Where this fits in ESPnet3

Recipe-local dataset code usually lives under:

```text
egs3/<recipe>/<system>/dataset/
  builder.py
  dataset.py
  config.yaml
```

![DatasetBuilder lifecycle](../images/data_builder.png)

That layer is usually driven by
[`DatasetBuilder`](../../../guide/espnet3/components/DatasetBuilder.html):

- [`is_source_prepared()`](../../../guide/espnet3/components/DatasetBuilder.html)
- [`prepare_source()`](../../../guide/espnet3/components/DatasetBuilder.html)
- [`is_built()`](../../../guide/espnet3/components/DatasetBuilder.html)
- [`build()`](../../../guide/espnet3/components/DatasetBuilder.html)

See:

- `egs3/mini_an4/asr/dataset/builder.py`
- `egs3/librispeech_100/asr/dataset/builder.py`

For simple recipes, `build()` can stay single-process.
For heavier recipes, the expensive part can use a provider/runner pair.

## Two levels of preparation

It helps to separate two kinds of work:

<div class='custom-h3'><ol>
<li>Builder lifecycle</li>
</ol></div>


This is the coarse recipe lifecycle:

- download or validate source data
- extract archives
- create final manifests

Example:

- `MiniAn4Builder.prepare_source()` extracts the archive
- `MiniAn4Builder.build()` converts audio and writes TSV manifests
- `LibriSpeech100Builder.prepare_source()` only validates the source tree

<div class='custom-h3'><ol>
<li>Parallel inner loop</li>
</ol></div>


This is the fine-grained loop inside one expensive step:

- process one utterance
- download one asset
- normalize one transcript
- compute one metadata record

That inner loop is where
[`EnvironmentProvider`](../../../guide/espnet3/parallel/EnvironmentProvider.html)
and [`BaseRunner`](../../../guide/espnet3/parallel/BaseRunner.html) fit.

## Real ESPnet3 example: collect-stats

The closest in-tree example today is not a dataset download stage.
It is `collect_stats`.

Implementation:

- `espnet3/components/data/collect_stats.py`
- [`CollectStatsInferenceProvider`](../../../guide/espnet3/components/CollectStatsInferenceProvider.html)
- [`CollectStatsRunner`](../../../guide/espnet3/components/CollectStatsRunner.html)

That code uses the same pattern:

- provider builds dataset, collate function, model, and device
- runner processes one batch or shard
- reducer hooks write shard files and merge them later

If you want to design a heavy dataset-preparation stage, this is the best
reference in the current codebase.

## Pattern for dataset preparation

Use this pattern when your recipe has many independent items to process.

The provider builds shared state once.
The runner handles one item at a time.

## Example: parallel download preparation

Imagine a recipe-local package like:

```text
egs3/falar/asr/dataset/
  builder.py
  download_parallel.py
```

The builder can stay responsible for lifecycle checks:

```python
from espnet3.components.data.dataset_builder import DatasetBuilder


class FalarBuilder(DatasetBuilder):
    def is_source_prepared(self, recipe_dir, **kwargs):
        ...

    def prepare_source(self, recipe_dir, **kwargs):
        ...

    def is_built(self, recipe_dir, **kwargs):
        ...

    def build(self, recipe_dir, **kwargs):
        # This is where a provider/runner pair can be used.
        ...
```

Then the expensive per-item work can move into a parallel helper module.

## Example: parallel download fan-out

This is the pattern you want when one dataset has many independent URLs.

```python
class DownloadProvider(EnvironmentProvider):
    def build_env_local(self):
        return {
            "items": load_download_plan(self.config.plan_path),
            "downloads_dir": Path(self.config.downloads_dir),
        }

    def build_worker_setup_fn(self):
        plan_path = self.config.plan_path
        downloads_dir = Path(self.config.downloads_dir)

        def setup():
            return {
                "items": load_download_plan(plan_path),
                "downloads_dir": downloads_dir,
            }

        return setup


class DownloadRunner(BaseRunner):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(idx, items, downloads_dir, **env):
        item = items[idx]
        target = downloads_dir / item["relative_path"]
        target.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
        download_one_file(item["url"], target)
        return {"path": str(target), "status": "ok"}
```

This keeps the download logic parallel-ready without forcing the builder itself
to know anything about Dask.


## Relation to existing recipe code

Current recipe examples show the builder side clearly:

- `MiniAn4Builder.build()` converts SPH to WAV and writes manifests
- `LibriSpeech100Builder` validates a raw directory-backed recipe

Current core examples show the parallel side clearly:

- [`CollectStatsInferenceProvider`](../../../guide/espnet3/components/CollectStatsInferenceProvider.html)
- [`CollectStatsRunner`](../../../guide/espnet3/components/CollectStatsRunner.html)

So a heavier dataset-preparation recipe usually combines those two ideas:

1. `builder.py` owns lifecycle checks
2. a provider/runner helper owns the parallel inner loop

## Output writing

Do not expect `return {"path": ...}` from `forward()` to create files.

The default path is only an in-memory shard state:

```text
forward(idx)
  -> result
  -> BaseRunner.write_record(...)
  -> state["records"].append(result)
  -> BaseRunner.merge(...)
  -> None
```

That means no SCP, TSV, or JSONL is written unless your runner writes it.

For real files, override the reducer hooks:

```python
class DownloadRunner(BaseRunner):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(idx, items, downloads_dir, **env):
        item = items[idx]
        target = downloads_dir / item["relative_path"]
        target.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
        download_one_file(item["url"], target)
        return {"path": str(target), "status": "ok"}

    @staticmethod
    def open_writers(shard_dir, **env):
        return {
            "manifest": (shard_dir / "downloads.tsv").open("w", encoding="utf-8"),
        }

    @staticmethod
    def write_record(writers, result, state, **env):
        writers["manifest"].write(f'{result["path"]}\t{result["status"]}\n')

    @staticmethod
    def close_writers(writers):
        writers["manifest"].close()

    def merge(self, shard_dirs):
        out_path = self.output_dir / "downloads.tsv"
        with out_path.open("w", encoding="utf-8") as out_f:
            for shard_dir in sorted(shard_dirs):
                part = shard_dir / "downloads.tsv"
                if part.exists():
                    out_f.write(part.read_text(encoding="utf-8"))
        return {"manifest": str(out_path)}
```

The output then looks like:

```text
downloads/
  manifest.json
  split.0/
    downloads.tsv
    done
  split.1/
    downloads.tsv
    done
  downloads.tsv
```

`InferenceRunner` is just a specialized version of this pattern:

```text
InferenceRunner.write_record(...)
  -> split.N/hyp.scp
  -> split.N/ref.scp

InferenceRunner.merge(...)
  -> hyp.scp
  -> ref.scp
```

For durable preparation outputs, use
[`BaseRunner`](../../../guide/espnet3/parallel/BaseRunner.html) reducer hooks such
as:

- [`open_writers()`](../../../guide/espnet3/parallel/BaseRunner.html)
- [`write_record()`](../../../guide/espnet3/parallel/BaseRunner.html)
- [`close_writers()`](../../../guide/espnet3/parallel/BaseRunner.html)
- [`merge()`](../../../guide/espnet3/parallel/BaseRunner.html)

That is the pattern used by
[`CollectStatsRunner`](../../../guide/espnet3/components/CollectStatsRunner.html).
It is better when shard outputs are too large to keep in memory.

## Common mistakes

- Putting heavy mutable state directly into the runner
- Doing all file writes inside `build()` with no per-item split
- Returning huge in-memory blobs instead of writing shard outputs
- Re-reading the full source manifest inside every `forward()` call
- Using provider/runner for a tiny one-shot shell task
